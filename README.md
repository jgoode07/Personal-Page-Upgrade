## Future Improvements

- Improe the responsive design by starting with a mobile-first approach and scaling up for larger screens.
- Add an image carousel in the Share section for destinations and movies to make browsing smoother and more responsive.
- Adjust the profile picture positioning so it sits centred, overlapping the top "About" container for a cleaner look.
